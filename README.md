# clitui
Automatic gui generation for cli tools.<br>
![Welcome to clitui](https://vhs.charm.sh/vhs-2LQpVjzHvC1QkOlJWM9k2J.gif)
Based on the help string provided by your cli tool, clitui will create a tui (terminal user interface) for you. As this is a very early version,
clitui only supports cli tools that use clap for command line handling. In the future, there will be support for more different types of help messages.

## Installation
```
cargo install clitui
```
